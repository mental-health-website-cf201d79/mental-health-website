                <h2>Our Questionnaire</h2>
                <p class="long">Our quiz is designed to quickly screen for an unknown presence of certain mental health conditions. 26% of the population is estimated to have a mental health condition, yet only 20% of the population has a mental health diagnosis. This difference suggests a prevalence of undiagnosed mental health conditions.</p>

                <p class="long">This Sunday, October 10, is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Mental_Health_Day">World Mental Health Day</a>! Mental health conditions are common and have real impact on people. Spreading awareness can expand our understanding of each other. More awareness can lead to incremental changes that can make the world more welcoming to our individual differences.</p>
