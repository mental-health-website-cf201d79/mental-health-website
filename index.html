            <p class="long">Our quiz is designed to quickly screen for an unknown presence of a mental health condition. 26% of the population is estimated to have a mental health condition, yet only 20% of the population has a mental health diagnosis. This difference suggests a prevalence of undiagnosed mental health conditions.</p>

            <p class="long">Mental health conditions have real impact on people. Spreading awareness can expand our understanding of each other. More awareness can lead to incremental changes that can make the world can be a little more accomodating to our individual differences.</p>
