            <p>Our quiz is designed to quickly screen for the unknown presence of a mental health condition. X% of the population has a mental health diagnosis, yet Y% is estimated to have a mental health condition. This difference suggests any individual may unknowingly have an undiagnosed condition. This questionnaire screens for mental health conditions, and the awareness it may bring can lead to happier outcomes.</p>

            <p>Mental health conditions have real impact on people. The contents of our quiz is one way to communicate the variety of that impact. Spreading awareness can expand our understanding of each other. More understanding can lead to re-evaluation of our individual actions and social norms. Hopefully more awareness can lead to incremental changes that can make the world can be a little more accomodating to our individual differences.</p>
