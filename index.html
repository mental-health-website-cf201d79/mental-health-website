            <p>Our quiz is designed to quickly screen for the presence for mental health conditions that might not already be known. X% of the population has a mental health diagnosis. Y% is estimated to have a mental health condition. This difference suggests a high possibility of having an undiagnosed condition. This questionnaire screens for mental health conditions that have hopeful treatments which might open the door to a happier life.</p>

            <p>Mental health conditions have real impact on people. The contents of our quiz is one way to communicate the variety of that impact. Spreading awareness can expand our understanding of each other. More understanding can lead to re-evaluation of our individual actions and social norms. Hopefully more awareness can lead to continuous incremental changes that will make the world can be a little more accomodating to our individual differences, and more happiness for everyone</p>
