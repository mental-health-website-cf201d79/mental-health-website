            <p>Our quiz is designed to quickly screen for the unknown presence of a mental health condition. 26% of the population is estimated to have a mental health condition, yet only 20% of the population has a mental health diagnosis. This difference suggests a prevalence of undiagnosed and untreated mental health conditions. This screening quiz may open an opportunity to an improved quality of life.</p>

            <p>Mental health conditions have real impact on people. Spreading awareness can expand our understanding of each other. More understanding can lead to re-evaluation of our individual actions and social norms. Hopefully more awareness can lead to incremental changes that can make the world can be a little more accomodating to our individual differences.</p>
